# GitLab2023
## Description
This is the GitHub repo that was created for Lab 1. We are learning how to use Git and GitHub while also relearning the basics of Eclipse.
~~Eclipse sucks~~ Man that's crazy who said that.

We will eventually be `pushing` and `pulling` items from this repo as we continue through the lab.

We will also be getting onto our partner's repo so we can **fumble** our way through learning how all of this works.
